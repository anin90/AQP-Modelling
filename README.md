# AQP-Modelling
Repository for the Computational Modelling of Aquaporin (AQP) Co-regulation in Cancer

This repository contains models constructed for the project "Computational Modelling of Aquaporin (AQP) Co-regulation in Cancer", undertaken in the group of Dr Benjamin Hall at the MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge in summer 2017.

There are two models in this repository, both of which can be opened in the software BioModelAnalyzer (http://biomodelanalyzer.org/ or https://github.com/Microsoft/BioModelAnalyzer/):

InitialModel.json - the initial, primitive model generated from manual curation of 30 publications; AND
RefinedModel.json - the finalized, refined model generated from modularization and a further curation of 30 publications.

The author is grateful for any comments which may be sent to jz406@cam.ac.uk.
